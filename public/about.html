<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am 24 years old and during those years I've been obsessed with computers.
  I been on the internet for over a decade with little trace. I'm always up to learn more about computers. My faith is very important to me.
  I'm doing this to use my time wisely to learn web development and hopefuly one day make a career out of this.
</p>

<p>I love video games and anime. I hope to one day travel to Japan. I also hope to learn Japanese one day. I've built my own computer to play the games I want. I've been hospitalized multiple times this year. I thank God for getting me through it every time.</p>

<p>I am intersted in making friends with similar interests. I hope to make entertaing videos that people can enjoy one day.</p>
